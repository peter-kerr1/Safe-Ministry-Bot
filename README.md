# Safe Ministry Bot

This bot (a program that can perform tasks automatically) is designed to be used in conjunction with a suitably configured Discord server to enable young people of youth group age and their leaders to communicate together in a group setting online, while adhering to Safe Ministry guidelines. The primary feature that sets Discord apart from other social media platforms is the fact that it offers voice communication - this also presents additional Safe Ministry challenges, and is one of the problems that this bot has been created to solve.

The following source material was used as the basis for the Safe Ministry guidelines that the Discord server follows / this bot enforces:  
- [Social Contact Policy v3.1](https://safeministry.org.au/wp-content/uploads/pdf/PSU_SocialContactPolicy_v3_1.pdf)
  - Social media sections
- [Safe Ministry Blueprint for Youth Ministry Leaders](https://safeministry.org.au/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SM-BlueprintForYthMinLeaders.pdf)
  - Section 5: The Golden Rules
  - Section 5.g: Communication
- [COVID-19 - Using Video Conferencing](https://safeministry.org.au/covid-19-principles-when-using-video-conferencing/?fbclid=IwAR33oCo0xghOn5uiSCGxzwrUQnvTMpXEG7nUpol0GNGCiKyvuI0MFoDnWoo)
  - A lot of the principles from this page have been applied, though no video functionality is allowed on the Discord server.
  

***But wait, how do the Safe Ministry guidelines allow a youth discord server to exist?***  
Most of the guidelines regarding online interaction address one-to-one conversations, such as phone calls, texts and emails. The discord server that this bot is designed to reside in is built to facilitate group interaction between multiple young people and leaders, never one-to-one communication. As such, the server most closely falls into the category of 'Social Media' for the first two documents listed above, rendering it subject primarily to 'The Ten' outlined in the [Safe Ministry Blueprint for Youth Ministry Leaders](https://safeministry.org.au/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SM-BlueprintForYthMinLeaders.pdf), and 'discretion'.

***So what's the bot for?***  
Discord allows for groups of members to interact in text 'channels', much like a youth group Facebook page where all conversations are visible to everyone in the group. Discord also has voice channels however, which allow for what are effectively group phone calls. The Safe Ministry guidelines do not directly address *group* phone calls, so instead we must apply the principles outlined elsewhere in the guideline, namely 'The Golden Rules'.

Without modification, Discord could allow one young person and one leader to join a voice channel together, which would be a breach of the golden rules 'Two or More' and 'Never Alone'. With this bot in the server, it will prevent group members from hearing each other until there are at least two leaders in the voice channel, thus 'enforcing' the Safe Ministry guideline.
